<h1>Taylor Millin-Reade Report: IS51018B Large Coursework</h1>

<p><strong>Link to my website:</strong> <a href="index.html">doc.gold.ac.uk/~tmill004/webdev/portfoliosite/index.html</a></p>

<p><strong>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</strong> These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.</p>

<p>I was inspired by the simple shapes and natural forms of artists such as used in the mark making by such artists as Richard Long and Yayoi Kusama. I decided when creating the site that I wanted it to be distinguished from the majority of other websites that seem to have light colour schemes as their background.  Ii gained inspiration from some sites Ifound on awwwards.com that use darker colour schemes such as http://www.formigari.it/ and https://garden-eight.com/. I also feel that the javascript animation i used as a background complements the waveform patterns of my audio visualiser.</p>

<p><strong>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</strong></p>

<p>All my images have equivalent alternative text to allow anyone using a screen reader to have a description of the image. For users that can only use a keyboard I adjusted the focus indicator to be 3px thick and changed the colour to compliment the colour scheme of the website. I chose to have a contrasting background colour to the white text this helps people who are visually impared to read text on the page.</p>

<p><strong>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</strong></p>

<p>As people commonly read a web page as they woulda piece of writing from top left across to the right then down,  i placed the title and the home page link of the website in the top left. This allows the user to instantly be able to know what site they are on. Just below the title is the menu bar.  this as the second thing that the user will register allows them to instantly navigate the site. I also included a second menu at the bottom of each page with links to the rest of the site; this allows the user to navigate the site after getting to the end of a page without having to scroll back to the top of the page.</p>

<p><strong>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</strong> (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</p>

<p>I learnt that using the form action="mailto:” i couldenter my email address. on most browsers this will open up the user’s email application when submit is pressed and fill in a new email with the info entered in the form.and my email address. I learnt that I could implement a hover style to a video allowing the size of the video window to change when the mouse is over it. I learnt when implementing the javascript background that if it calls upon an element in your html that element needs to be before the javascript function is called.</p>

<p><strong>What changes did you make to your site in response to the feedback you received for your first submission?</strong> Feedback was shared with you on the department intranet. If this is your first submisison, just write, `Not applicable'.</p>

<p>Not applicable</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other changes you made which you feel have improved the site?</strong> If so, explain why you decided to make the changes, and how they have improved the site. If this is your first submission, tell us here what you think has gone well with your submission.</p>

<p>I feel that one of the things i feel has gone well is the implementation of a javascript animation as a background. I feel this gives a slight feeling of motion stopping the site from feeling too static and rigid.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any aspect(s) of your work that could still be improved, and if so, how might you achieve this?</strong> If this is your first submission, tell us here what you feel the weaknesses of the project are, and how you might do things differently another time.</p>

<p>The one aspect that I struggled with when creating my website was making it responsive so that it works properly on all mobile devices. Sadly I was not able to get this to work properly, meaning that it will not be usable by a large group of users.</p>

<p><strong>What resources were used when creating your work?</strong> You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.</p>
